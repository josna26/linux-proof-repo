## Notes


### 🔹 Dual Boot Installation
Setting up dual booting configuration of Kali Linux helps us understand how multiple operating systems can run in a single system. The most important step during this process would be assigning a proper disk partition for space allocation. The bootloader, which opens when the system turns on, allows us to select between Windows and Kali Linux. This confirms that the installation was successful.

### 🔹 What I Observed While Using Linux
- The Linux file system is hierarchical and starts from the root directory (/).
- Navigation through directories or folders can be done using terminal commands.
- We can perform powerful operations by combining different commands using pipes(|).
- Linux also provides a very detailed permission structure for security purposes.
- Hidden system configuration files in the home directory start with a dot (for example, .bashrc).

### 🔹 Differences Between Windows and Linux
- Linux uses package managers like apt for software installations, unlike Windows, which relies on .exe files.
- System updates can be easily handled using terminal commands.
- In Linux, we are able to manage almost everything through CLI, while Windows relies heavily on GUI.
- File permissions like read, write and execute are clearly visible using the command ls -l.
- Kali Linux comes pre-installed with various cybersecurity tools, making it suitable for security-focused learning.
